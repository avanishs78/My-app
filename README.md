# My Notes

# NPM - npm is a package manager for node but it doesn't stand for 'Node package manager'. Npm doesn't have any full form.

# How to add npm to project-
#### 1. run 'npm init' and follow the commands.
#### 2. it will create a package.json file. Package.json is a configuration for npm. It will take records of version of packages installed in project.

# Bundler - (npx create-react-app uses webpack as bundler behind the scenes)- ex - parcel, webpack
## Parcel - (for dev build run 'npx parcel index.html)
#### 1. Parcel Bundler is a powerful tool that developers use to bundle web resources. 
#### 2.It is a web application bundler that offers a seamless experience for developers. 
#### 3.The tool is used for bundling, which is the process of following imported files and merging them into a single file or multiple files.
#### 4.This process enhances the performance of the web app by reducing the number of HTTP requests

### **Note -**  Parcel does -
#### -Dev build 
#### -Local server 
#### -HMR- Hot Module Replacement 
#### -Compress
#### -File Watching Alogorithm- written in c++ 
#### -Caching - Faster Builds 
#### -Image Optimization 
#### -Minification 
#### -Bundling 
#### -Consistent Hashing
#### -Code Splittng
#### -Differential Bundling -support older browser
#### -Diagnostic
#### -Error Handling
#### -HTTPs
#### -Tree Shaking - remove unused code
#### -Different dev and prod bundles

#### **imp note** - To build for prod -> remove 'main:App.js' form package.json and run 'npx parcel build index.html'


## Parcel vs Webpack: A Comparative Analysis
#### 1. Parcel and Webpack are both popular web application bundlers, but they have different approaches and features.

#### 2. Webpack is known for its flexibility and extensive configuration options. It allows developers to control every aspect of the bundling process through configuration files. However, this flexibility comes with a steep learning curve, especially for beginners.

#### 3. On the other hand, Parcel is known for its simplicity and zero-configuration feature. It doesn't require any configuration files to bundle a web app.

#### 4. Parcel is also faster than Webpack because it utilizes multiple cores for bundling, which makes it an excellent choice for large projects.

## Difference between tilde ( ~ ) and caret ( ^ ) in package.json
### Syntax of npm version - "Major.Minor.Patch"
#### Tilde (~) notation: It matches the latest patch version while freezing the major and minor versions
#### Example: The ~1.2.0 will update all the future patch updates. We have to write just ~1.2.0 and all the next patch update dependencies. For example, 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.5‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶1.2.x.
#### Caret (^) notation: It automatically updates both minor and patch updates.
#### Example: The ^1.2.4 will update all the future Minor and patch updates, for example, ^1.2.4 will automatically change the dependency to 1.x.x if any update occurs.

## Difference between package.json and package-lock.json files
## The role of Package.json:
#### 1. Project configuration - package.json serves as a manifest file for Node projects, containing metadata about the project and its dependencies. It includes information such as the project name, version, entry point, scripts, and dependencies.
#### 2. Dependency Management: Dependencies are listed in the ‚Äúdependencies‚Äù section, specifying the packages required for the project to run. Developers can use the npm install command to install dependencies listed in the package.json.
#### 3. Version Management: Versions of dependencies may be specified with semantic versioning (SemVer) rules in the package.json. This file is typically committed to version control systems (e.g., Git) to share project configurations. 
## The Role of package-lock.json:
#### 1. Dependency Locking: package-lock.json is an auto-generated file that provides a detailed, deterministic record of the dependency tree. It locks down the specific versions of every installed package, preventing unintended updates.
#### 2. Version Consistency: This file ensures that every developer working on the project, as well as the CI/CD system, uses the exact same versions of dependencies. Guarantees consistent builds across different environments, avoiding ‚Äúit works on my machine‚Äù issues.
#### 3. Improved Installation Speed: package-lock.json optimizes dependency installation by storing a flat node_modules structure, reducing the need for deep dependency resolution during installation. This results in faster and more reliable installations.

## node_modules
#### node_modules contains all dependency packages and libraries. With the help of package.json and package-lock.json, we can install all the dependencies and recreate node_modules by running command 'npm install'. This is why no need to push node_modules to git repo.

## Transitive dependency: 
#### Our project has dependency of parcel and parcel has dependency of lot of other libraries. This is known as transitive dependency.

## Dev dependencies vs normal dependencies ?

## React Element :
#### React Element is an object. When we render it on DOM then it becomes and an html element
#### React Element => ReactElement- JS Object => HTMLElement(render)
#### const title = ()=> (
#### <h1 className='heading'>
####  Namaste React with JSXüöÄ
####  </h1> 
####  );

## JSX :
#### It is a syntax extension to javascript. It is HTML-like or XML-like syntax. JSX produces React elements. JSX is transpiled by babel before it reaches JS.
#### JSX => React.createElement => ReactElement-JS Object => HTMLElement(render)

#### **Creating React element using React.createElement:**
#### const heading = React.createElement('h1',{id:'heading'},'React ElementüöÄ');

#### **Creating React element using JSX:**
#### const jsxHeading = <h1 id="heading">React Element with JSXüöÄ</h1>;

#### **Note:** Browsers(js engine) don't understand jsx. Transpilers or javascript compilers (i.e babel) converts jsx to a code that js engine understands.

## React Component:
#### Two ways of creating React Component-
#### 1.Class Based Components
#### 2.Function COmponents - Normal JS function which returns a jsx.
#### const HeadingComponent = () => {return <h1 className='heading'>My React Functional Component</h1>};

## Component composition: One component used inside other component as children is known as component composition

## Props:
#### passing props to components is same as Passing arguements to functions.
#### Through props we pass data from parent to child components.

## Config driven UI: 
## Optional Chaining:
## Key in array.map: It is used to uniquely identify each element. Using index as key is not recommended.

## .js vs .jsx file ?

## export default vs named export?

### Default export/import - 
#### export default Component;
#### import Component from "path";

### Named export/import - 
#### export const Component;
#### import {Component} from "path";

## React Hooks
#### These are normal javascript functions used in functional components.

## Reconciliation Algorithm (React Fiber):

#### React Reconciliation is the process through which React updates the Browser DOM. It makes the DOM updates faster in React. It updates the virtual DOM first and then uses the diffing algorithm to make efficient and optimized updates in the Real DOM.

### How it works:
#### React stores a copy of Browser DOM which is called Virtual DOM.
#### When we make changes or add data, React creates a new Virtual DOM and compares it with the previous one.
#### Comparison is done by Diffing Algorithm. The cool fact is all these comparisons take place in the memory and nothing is yet changed in the Browser.
#### After comparing, React goes ahead and creates a new Virtual DOM having the changes. It is to be noted that as many as 200,000 virtual DOM nodes can be produced in a second.
#### Then it updates the Browser DOM with the least number of changes possible without rendering the entire DOM again. This changes the efficiency of an application tremendously

## Virtual DOM : memory representation of actual DOM

#### The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the ‚Äúreal‚Äù DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called reconciliation.

## Virtual DOM Key Concepts :

#### Virtual DOM is the virtual representation of Real DOM
#### React update the state changes in Virtual DOM first and then it syncs with Real DOM
#### Virtual DOM is just like a blueprint of a machine, can do changes in the blueprint but those changes will not directly apply to the machine.
#### Virtual DOM is a programming concept where a virtual representation of a UI is kept in memory synced with ‚ÄúReal DOM ‚Äù by a library such as ReactDOM and this process is called reconciliation
#### Virtual DOM makes the performance faster, not because the processing itself is done in less time The reason is the amount of changed information ‚Äì rather than wasting time on updating the entire page, you can dissect it into small elements and interactions
